## Overview <a name="overview"></a>

The primary objective of the Code Conversion, Debugging, and Quality Check Application is to provide developers with a convenient tool to perform code conversion, debugging, and quality checks. By integrating OpenAI's GPT model, the application can generate converted code, debug code snippets, and provide suggestions for code quality improvements.

## Features <a name="features"></a>

The application offers the following features:

1. **Code Conversion**: Allows users to convert code from one programming language to another. It supports multiple programming languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript, C, Rust, and Go.
2. **Code Debugging**: Helps users debug their code by identifying errors and providing suggestions for fixes.
3. **Code Quality Check**: Evaluates the quality of provided code by assessing style, organization, and potential improvements.

## Architecture <a name="architecture"></a>

The Code Conversion, Debugging, and Quality Check Application consists of two main components: the frontend and the backend.

### Frontend
The frontend is responsible for providing the user interface and handling user interactions. It is built using React.js with the support of the Monaco Editor for code input.

The frontend performs the following tasks:
- Displays the code editor for users to input their code.
- Provides a dropdown menu to select the target programming language for code conversion.
- Sends requests to the backend API for code conversion, debugging, and quality check.
- Receives the output from the backend and displays it in a readable format.

### Backend
The backend is developed using Node.js and serves as the server-side logic for the application. It handles requests from the frontend, interacts with OpenAI's GPT model, and returns the processed results to the frontend.

The backend performs the following tasks:
- Receives requests from the frontend for code conversion, debugging, and quality check.
- Communicates with OpenAI's GPT model using the OpenAI API.
- Processes the requests, prepares the appropriate prompts for the GPT model, and sends them for processing.
- Receives the model's response, extracts the relevant information, and sends it back to the frontend.

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>

To use the Code Conversion, Debugging, and Quality Check Application, follow the instructions below.

### Frontend Usage <a name="frontend-usage"></a>

1. Open the application in a web browser.
2. You will see a code editor where you can write your code.
3. Select the target programming language for code conversion from the dropdown menu.
4. Click the "Convert" button to convert your code, "Debug" button to debug your code, or "Check Quality" button to perform a quality check.
5. Wait for the output to appear in the designated

output area.

### Backend Usage <a name="backend-usage"></a>

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
2. Clone the project repository and navigate to the backend directory.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the command: `npm install`.
4. Set up your environment variables by creating a `.env` file and adding the necessary configurations, such as the OpenAI API key.
5. Start the backend server by running the command: `npm start`.
6. The server will be running at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>

The Code Conversion, Debugging, and Quality Check Application provides a user-friendly web-based tool for developers to convert code, debug code snippets, and perform quality checks. By leveraging OpenAI's GPT model, it offers accurate results and suggestions for improving code quality. The frontend interface allows easy interaction, while the backend handles the processing and communication with the GPT model. With this application, developers can streamline their coding tasks and enhance their productivity.
